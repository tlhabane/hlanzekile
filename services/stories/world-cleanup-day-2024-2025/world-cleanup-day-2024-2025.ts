        "Hlanzekile River and Ocean Cleaning marked World Cleanup Day in both 2024 and 2025, mobilising communities across Soweto and Bryanston to take action for cleaner rivers and healthier environments.",
        "On World Cleanup Day 2024, Hlanzekile partnered with community members and learners from Shomang Primary School to clean the Kliprivier in Soweto. Despite challenging weather conditions, volunteers removed 50 bags of waste and unveiled a “No Dumping” sign, reinforcing a strong message against illegal dumping and promoting long-term river protection.",
        "In 2025, World Cleanup Day saw Hlanzekile shift focus to Bryanston, where volunteers and partners united to restore the Braamfontein Spruit River. The initiative resulted in the removal of over 340 kilograms of waste, made possible through collaboration with ADT Security and the Bryanston East Community Forum.",
        "These consecutive World Cleanup Day initiatives highlight the power of community-driven action and strategic partnerships in addressing pollution and restoring South Africa’s urban waterways. Through sustained engagement year after year, Hlanzekile continues to turn collective effort into lasting environmental impact."
